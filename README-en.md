## Project

The purpose of this repository is to provide articles about ​​software development translated into Portuguese. All the content is focused on people who are starting their adventures in this area.

## Motivation

Why have a repository with articles translated into Portuguese? In this area it is very common to hear that knowing English is required to start, otherwise we will not be able to consume good quality content. But when we say this we are already segregating people before they ever enter the world. Why hinder people's entry if we can help them?

This repository is for this, we want to curate articles `entrylvl` with translation into Portuguese.

## Community

For people who already have mastery over English, we believe that this is an opportunity to further expand their knowledge, since for the translation of an article people must understand the context and meaning of each word.

For those who will consume the content, as these persons begins to feel more comfortable with English and start to use the translation as a way of learning.
